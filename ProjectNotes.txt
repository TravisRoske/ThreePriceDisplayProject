//loading order
	first load the lighting and background
	then the ground plane
		//ground plane is repeated squares, stretch into the distance
	start the loop
		//the loop loads consoles when the api calls are returned.
	
    

//main loop,
	every second?, sends a new api call to a different coin in the list
	that's it, everything else is handled anyways with the callbacks
	in the normal js event loop



//Consoles
	Spawner
		a new console spawns underground
		the floor opens up, and a new console moves up

		lights turn bright again and the price changes
