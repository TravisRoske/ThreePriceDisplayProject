//This loop will run continuously
//it will spawn in, then update maybe 50 display prices.
//it will update them a few times a second
//So it will loop through an array of all the different coins/stocks
    //and send a call every time interval.
    //when the call returns, that will call the callback funtion to update or create the price.


    
//console objects will also despawn if you get too far away...
    //So new ones will spawn near you....
